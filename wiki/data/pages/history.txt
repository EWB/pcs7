The Potsdam Co-op has come a long way since its beginning as a Buying Club in 1972. The Co-op has been dedicated to meeting the community's need for specialty and whole foods ever since it opened its retail doors in 1973. As a consumer cooperative, The Potsdam Co-op exists for the benefit of the people who use it.

The Co-op has had several locations in Potsdam. The current Elm Street location was purchased in 1992 by the Member-Owners. The Carriage House Bakery was established on the property in 2002.

The Potsdam Food Co-op is a democratic enterprise that is owned and governed by its Member-Owners. All profits generated by the business must be returned to the Member-Owners, either directly or via improvements to the shared enterprise. Cooperatives are based on the values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. Cooperative members accept the ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring for others.

Anyone can become a Member-Owner. While Member-Owners enjoy special benefits, non-members are welcome to shop at the co-op.

An elected Board of Directors represents the Member-Owners. The board operates under Policy Governance; the Board of Directors establishes policies, which are interpreted by the General Manager and carried out by the staff of the store and monitored by the Board of Directors.

Currently, the Co-op has over 900 Member-Owner Households.
