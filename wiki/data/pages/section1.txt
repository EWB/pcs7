===== Mission Statement =====
The Potsdam Consumer Cooperative Mission

The Potsdam Co-op is owned and operated by its members and is dedicated to meeting the communityâ€™s need for specialty and whole foods at the lowest possible cost.  
As a member of the local community interested in its well being, we will attempt to use local sources whenever feasible.  We strive to provide a pleasant shopping and working environment, with an emphasis on education, shared information and developing our relationship with the community.  We encourage environmental respect through the goods we sell and in the manner in which we conduct our daily operations.  
We are committed to providing a model of responsible business practices based on the cooperative principles of open membership, democratic control, limited return on share capital or investments, return of surplus to members, continuous education, and cooperation among cooperatives, and concern for our local community.
